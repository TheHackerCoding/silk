# `silk` - something to split and join files (wip)

# Install

¯\_◉‿◉_/¯ dat takes too much work to document...u can easily figure it out by just cloning the repo and running `dart main.dart` (ignore `old_main.dart` that file right there is a complete mess)

# What do need to run this

literally just dart

# What is this tested on?

ubuntu linux because linux is better and faster than windows when it comes to developing stuff like this

# Why?

¯\_◉‿◉_/¯ because i just felt like it
